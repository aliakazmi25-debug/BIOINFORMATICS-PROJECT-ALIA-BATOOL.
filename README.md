SUMMARY:This repository presents a complete bioinformatics characterization of the hsp20 (ibpB) gene from Klebsiella pneumoniae, located on a plasmid-based mobile genetic element. The analysis begins with DNA-level investigation, including BLAST-based gene identification, ORF detection, GC content estimation, and repeat analysis, confirming a 570 bp coding region with 59% GC content and no tandem repeats. RNA analysis involved mRNA feature prediction and secondary structure modeling to assess transcript stability. Protein-level characterization revealed a 189 amino acid small heat shock protein (sHSP) with conserved features typical of the HSP20/ibpB family, supported by physicochemical property analysis and domain predictions. Subcellular localization tools consistently predicted cytosolic localization, aligning with the functional role of small heat shock proteins as molecular chaperones. Finally, phylogenetic analysis using multiple sequence alignment and the Neighbor-Joining method demonstrated evolutionary conservation of ibpB across related species, highlighting its functional importance and mobility via plasmid association.
